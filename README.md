Shein Shoe Data Scraper

This project is designed to automatically extract detailed product information for shoes from the
Shein website. The extracted data includes the product name, price, user reviews, and ratings,
providing a comprehensive overview of the product listings. The process leverages web scraping
techniques to navigate and parse the websiteâ€™s content, ensuring accurate and up-to-date data
collection. The collected information is then organized and stored in a structured .csv format,
making it easy to analyze, visualize, or integrate into other applications. This tool is ideal for 
e-commerce analysis, price tracking, or customer sentiment research.
